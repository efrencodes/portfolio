I’m Efren Martinez, a mid-senior frontend engineer at OCC Mundial, developing digital products and collaborating with UI/UX, Infrastructure, Project Managers and Backend teams.

I’m fluent in JavaScript, React, and Vue.js. I’ve also written a significant amount of HTML and CSS. I learn quickly, pay attention to detail, and am passionate about computer science.
My current tech stack includes:

    * Frontend: **HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Astro, Next.js, React, Vuejs, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, SEO**

    * Backend: **PHP, GraphQL, Apollo Server**

    * Mobile: **React Native, Expo, Zustand**

    * Testing: **Unit tests with Jest, React Testing Library, E2E tests with Cypress**

    * Tools: **Git, GitHub, VSCode, Figma**

    * Infrastructure: **Docker**

In this year 2025, I want to learn about UI/UX and mobile programming
